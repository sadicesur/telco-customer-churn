In today's dynamic business landscape, predicting customer behaviors holds immense significance. This project revolves around developing a machine learning model to predict customer churn, a critical business concern where customers discontinue using a service. By delving into real-world data from a Telco company, this Jupyter Notebook aims to construct a predictive model capable of identifying potential churners. The process involves data preprocessing, trend exploration, and the implementation of various machine learning techniques to extract insights and construct an effective prediction tool. This project empowers businesses with the capacity to proactively address customer attrition, thus bolstering customer retention strategies and overall operational efficacy.

## Dataset Information

The Telco customer churn dataset offers insights into an imaginary telecommunications company that serves home phone and internet services to 7,043 customers in California during the third quarter. It elucidates whether customers have departed, remained, or subscribed to services. The dataset comprises 21 variables and encompasses 7,043 observations, with a total size of 977.5 KB.

Key Variables:

- **CustomerId**: Unique customer identifier
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer
- **SeniorCitizen**: Whether the customer is a senior citizen (1: Yes, 0: No)
- **Partner**: Whether the customer has a partner (Yes, No)
- **Dependents**: Whether the customer has dependents (Yes, No)
